# English-to-Yoruba Transformer

Welcome to the **Yoruba-to-English Transformer** project! This repository contains a custom-built transformer model that translates text from Yoruba to English. 🚀

### 🔍 **Project Overview**
This project aims to build a transformer model from scratch, leveraging the power of deep learning to create an accurate and efficient translation system. We are working with Python, PyTorch, and Transformer architectures to implement this solution.

### 🧠 **Goals**
- Develop a transformer model from scratch.
- Translate text from English to Yoruba.
- Continuously improve the model’s performance and accuracy.

### ⚙️ **Core Components**
- **Custom Transformer Architecture:** Built from scratch to handle translation tasks.
- **Yoruba-to-English Dataset:** Training the model with a relevant dataset for language translation.
- **Evaluation & Fine-tuning:** Monitoring performance metrics and optimizing accuracy.

### 🚧 **Work in Progress**
This project is a work in progress, and the repository will be regularly updated with new features, improvements, and results. Stay tuned for more details!

### 🤝 **Contributing**
