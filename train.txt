Summary of the Code's Purpose:
This code helps create a custom tokenizer based on your text data for both source and target languages. It uses the WordLevel tokenizer, which assigns tokens to whole words, making it suitable for applications where word-level tokenization suffices.
The tokenizer can be reused once saved, which helps reduce redundant work, especially when working with large datasets.
Next steps might include:

Applying the tokenizer to your dataset to convert sentences into tokenized sequences.
Integrating the tokenized data into your Transformer model pipeline for training and inference.
This approach allows the flexibility to create language-specific tokenizers and handle cases where some tokens need special treatment (like padding or start/end markers).



The main purpose of this code is to create a PyTorch Dataset that prepares bilingual data for the Transformer model. The dataset handles tokenization, adds special tokens like <s> (start of sequence) and </s> (end of sequence), applies padding, and generates masks for training.

The dataset is designed to feed the Transformer model during training by:

Tokenizing source and target sentences.
Padding sequences to ensure they are of the same length.
Adding special tokens to the sequences.
Generating input and target pairs for the Transformer.
Creating attention masks to ignore padding tokens during training.

The training.py script sets up the preprocessing pipeline for training a transformer model, including dataset loading, tokenization, splitting into training/validation sets, and creating data loaders.
Key Sections:
Tokenization: Create or load tokenizers to convert text into numerical tokens.
Dataset Creation: Load and clean the dataset, then split it into training and validation sets.
Data Loaders: Create loaders that handle batching and shuffling of the data.
Sequence Length Calculation: Calculate the maximum sequence length for efficient padding and tokenization, which is crucial for transformers.

Goals of This Stage:
Train the Model: This stage ensures that your Transformer model is being trained by learning from data, calculating losses, and optimizing its weights.
Track Training Progress: By logging loss values and periodically saving model checkpoints, you can monitor how well the model is learning and resume training if needed.
Prevent Overfitting: The loss function uses label smoothing to combat overfitting, which will help the model generalize better.
Next Steps:
Train for Multiple Epochs: Let the model train over the specified number of epochs (config['num_epochs']) while monitoring the loss and ensuring the model improves over time.
Validation Step: After each epoch, it would be helpful to evaluate the model on a validation set to track how well it generalizes.
Tuning Hyperparameters: Adjust the learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters if the model is underperforming or not improving as expected.
